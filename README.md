# Twitter DAPP

A Decentralized version of Twitter which is running on the Ethereum blockchain. This DAPP prevents censorship and allows people to have the freedom to post whatever they want. They can also tip ether to the author of the tweet. I used Next.JS , Tailwind CSS , Solidity and Hardhat ETH development environment to build this DAPP.
